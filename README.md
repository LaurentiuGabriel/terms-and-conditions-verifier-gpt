# Terms and Conditions Verifier GPT
Terms and Conditions Verifier GPT is a Chrome extension that enables users to verify the authenticity of the terms and conditions of any website or online service. This extension uses the ChatGPT language model to analyze the selected text and determine whether there are any suspicious or fishy clauses in the terms and conditions.

## How to use the extension
To use the Terms and Conditions Verifier GPT extension, follow these steps:

- Run `npm install`.
- Run `npm start` to start the server.
- Create an `.env` file based on the env-example file and provide your username and password for ChatGPT.
- Install the extension locally in your Chrome
- Go to the website or online service whose terms and conditions you want to verify.
Select the relevant text that contains the terms and conditions. You can select the entire text or a specific section that you want to verify.
- Right-click on the selected text and choose "Verify with ChatGPT" from the context menu.
The extension will send the selected text to the ChatGPT language model, which will analyze it and provide a report on whether there are any fishy or suspicious clauses in the terms and conditions.
## Features
Terms and Conditions Verifier GPT has the following features:

- Easy to use: The extension is very user-friendly and requires no technical knowledge to use.
- Customizable: Users can select the specific section of the terms and conditions that they want to verify.
- Fast and efficient: The extension uses the ChatGPT language model to analyze the text, which is both fast and accurate.
Safe and secure: The extension does not collect or store any personal data, ensuring the privacy of the user.
## Limitations
While Terms and Conditions Verifier GPT can be a useful tool for analyzing the terms and conditions of websites and online services, it has some limitations:

- It is not foolproof: The extension is not guaranteed to catch every fishy clause in the terms and conditions. Users should still exercise caution and read the terms and conditions carefully before agreeing to them.
- You must split long terms and conditions text to match the input requirements for chatGPT

### Alternative
You can use the API directly using an HTTP client. To achieve this, do the following:
1. Run `npm install`.
2. Run `npm start` to start the server.
3. Make a POST request to the /eula-summary endpoint with a JSON payload:
```
{
  "message": "Terms and conditions text goes here"
}
```
The server will respond with a JSON object containing the summary generated by the ChatGPT model:
```
{
  "reply": "Summary goes here"
}
```
#### Customization
You can customize the behavior of the API by modifying the config.js file. This file contains a set of plugins that define the rules and parsers used by the ChatGPT model. You can add, remove, or modify these plugins to suit your needs.
